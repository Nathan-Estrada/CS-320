### A showcase of some of my work completed from my Software Test Automations &amp; QA class at SNHU
For my two projects for this class, I simulated the role of a software engineer for a non-existing software engineering company called Grand Strand Systems. I was provided with requirements from a client, and was to create an application and provide unit tests to ensure that the customerâ€™s requirements were being met.  The requirements for the application involved allowing users to create and manage contacts, tasks, and appointments, with all of these services having their own set of specified requirements. Below I assess various questions provided by my instructor in regards to the projects. 

* How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

In order to ensure that my code is functional and secure, I utilized practices of regression testing by testing my code iteratively, consistently writing tests as I developed various functions and aspects of my code. In doing so, I was able to catch any errors or security defects that my code may have possessed as soon as they were developed, instead of having to sort through a plethora of errors and defects at the end of development. 

* How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

In order to interpret user needs and incorporate them into the program, I carefully analyze any functionality requests from the client, as well as any provided user stories. Once I have a clear vision on what functionality the program will require, I develop code based off of the requirements and ensure that they match by conducting frequent testing by running the code, as well as running automated tests using testing frameworks such as Junit. 

* How do I approach designing software?
  
My approach for designing this program first consisted of getting a clear and thorough understanding of the requirements, in order to confidently deliver a product that I knew would fit client needs. I then began to develop the software, as well as developed tests for the software and any functionality of the code I have just built. Instead of writing my tests after I have already developed all of my code, I would create and implement tests for my code iteratively in order to resolve any errors as soon as possible. I also verified I had a high coverage percentage for whatever file I was testing, aiming for a coverage of at the very least 80%.
